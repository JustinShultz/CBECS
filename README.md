# CBECS
 This is a Jupyter Notebook exploration of the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). I am using this to improve my data science techniques with a dataset I care about. 

 The interactive Plotly graphics do not visualize in the GitHub preview. You will need to download and load the Jupyter Notebook and dependencies see them.
