# CBECS
 This is a Jupyter Notebook exploration of the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). I am using this to improve my data science techniques with a dataset I care about. 

 The interactive Plotly graphics do not visualize in the GitHub preview. You will need to download and load the Jupyter Notebook and dependencies see them. Alternatively, you can see an online version at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/JustinShultz/CBECS/blob/main/CBECS_Pandas.ipynb).
